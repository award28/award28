- 👋 Hi, I’m @award28
- 👀 I’m interested in building scrappy projects that make the lives of those around me a little easier :)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to scale an event driven system with some of the most friendliest and most brilliant people our industry has to offer.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects used by both my company and myself. Some of my favorites are: RabbitMQ, Terraform, Homebridge, Octopi, and some others.
